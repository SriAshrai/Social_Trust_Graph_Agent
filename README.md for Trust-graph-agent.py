Trust-graph-agent.py

This Python script defines the workflow for the Social Trust Graph Agent using the LangGraph framework. It orchestrates the process of ingesting new graph data, performing graph analysis, simulating privacy-preserving steps (ZKPs for endorsements, TEE for sensitive analysis), and recording the graph's verifiable hash on-chain.

üéØ Purpose
Agent Orchestration: Manages the entire lifecycle of updating and analyzing the social trust graph.

State Management: Defines and updates the SocialGraphAgentState as data flows through the workflow.

Tool Integration: Utilizes the graph_processor.py for core graph building and analysis.

Privacy Layer Simulation: Includes mock functions for:

ZK-verified Endorsements: Conceptually handles the generation/verification of ZKPs for individual endorsements, ensuring their validity without revealing sensitive criteria.

TEE Graph Analysis: Simulates secure processing of sensitive graph patterns within a Trusted Execution Environment.

On-Chain Interaction (Mock): Simulates recording the cryptographic hash of the current graph state to the TrustGraphRegistry.sol smart contract, ensuring verifiable integrity.


üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies


langgraph

langchain-core

asyncio (built-in)

hashlib (built-in)

Depends on all graph_processor.py dependencies as well.

üöÄ Usage

This script defines the social_trust_graph_app object, which is the compiled LangGraph workflow. It can be run directly to test the agent's full flow:

cd Social_Trust_Graph_Agent
python Trust-graph-agent.py

(Ensure graph_processor.py is in the same directory.)
