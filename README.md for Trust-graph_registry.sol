Trust-graph_registry.sol
This Solidity smart contract serves as the immutable on-chain registry for cryptographic hashes of the Social Trust Graph's state. It provides a public and verifiable anchor for the integrity and evolution of the decentralized trust network.

üéØ Purpose
Immutable Record: Stores a unique bytes32 hash representing a snapshot of the entire social trust graph at a specific point in time. This hash acts as a verifiable fingerprint.

Integrity Verification: Allows any off-chain entity to verify that a particular version of the trust graph (reconstructed or observed off-chain) matches the hash recorded on-chain, ensuring its integrity and immutability.

Event Logging: Emits GraphHashRecorded events for efficient off-chain monitoring and data indexing by other agents or services.

Access Control: Basic onlyOwner modifier to restrict who can record new graph hashes (in a production system, this would be managed by a dedicated agent management contract or DAO).

üõ†Ô∏è Development & Deployment

Solidity Version: pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

Development Frameworks: Typically developed, compiled, and deployed using:

Hardhat

Foundry

Compilation:

# Using Hardhat (from project root)
npx hardhat compile

# Using Foundry (from project root)
forge build

Deployment: Deploy to an EVM-compatible blockchain (e.g., Ethereum testnets like Sepolia, Polygon Mumbai, Arbitrum Sepolia).

üîó Interaction
recordGraphHash(...): Called by the authorized Social Trust Graph Agent (or its proxy) to submit new graph state hashes.

getGraphState(...): Public view function to retrieve recorded graph hashes by sessionId.
